## LCD Button
### Description
Coding an LCD screen to print the amount of times a button is pushed.   
### Lesson Learned 
Always check the wiring and LCD screen because sometimes the code isn't what is wrong it is something with the physical LCD screen. 
### Wiring Diagram 

## Servo Touch 
### Description 
Coding a servo to turn back and forth when a wire is touched. When one is touched it turns 180 degrees in one direction and when the other is touched it turns 180 degrees in the other direction.   
### Lesson Learned
### Wiring Diagram

## LED Fade
### Description
Coding an LED to fade in and out. 
### Lesson Learned
This is the first CircuitPython assignment we did so learning the new coding language was the main difficulty when doing this. 
### Wiring Diagram

### Distance Sensor
## Description
Controlling the color fade of the LED on the Metro board in relation to the distance sensor. 

CircuitPythonDistanceSensor.py - using a distance sensor the led on the metro went in a gradient of colors as something moves towards and away from the sensor

hello_vs_code.py - using the VS code we are able to code and add things to git faster
