## LCD Button
### Description
Coding an LCD screen to print the amount of times a button is pushed.   
### Lesson Learned 
Always check the wiring and LCD screen because sometimes the code isn't what is wrong it is something with the physical LCD screen.

## Servo Touch 
### Description 
Coding a servo to turn back and forth when a wire is touched. When one is touched it turns 180 degrees in one direction and when the other is touched it turns 180 degrees in the other direction.   
### Lesson Learned
Figuring out how to do touchio was slightlty complicated other than that I was able to figuer out this prettyeasily. All the wiring I already mainly knew hwo to do so that was helpful.

## LED Fade
### Description
Coding an LED to fade in and out. 
### Lesson Learned
This is the first CircuitPython assignment we did so learning the new coding language was the main difficulty when doing this.

## Distance Sensor
### Description
Controlling the color fade of the LED on the Metro board in relation to the distance sensor. 
### Lesson Learned
To me this code was really confusing to figure out. One of the main things was just trying to understand the code and all the values that controlled the colors.

## RBG Class
### Description
Using a class to create a change in colors in two LEDS. 
### Lesson Learned
This assignment I did with Piper so between the two of us we were able to figure out the code.

## Fancy LED
### Description
Using classes to have LEDS light up in certain patterns.
### Lesson Learned
I was able to understand the code and I was pretty sure it was working when a couple of my LEDs wouldn't light up. I realized that when rewiring my LEDs the pins weren't in the correct spot so two of the LEDS couldn't light up. After figuring that out it worked really smmoothly.
